### Synthetic Perception: installation view
 
*Synthetic Perception* is an ongoing research project into the behavioural effects of digital surveillance culture on everyday social interactions. 

As a year long Honours project. I experimented with using computer vision algorithms to fragment and deidentify video data. 

That data was then recomposed and output onto a display medium. These included computer screens, televisions and smartphones.

### Synthetic Perception: installation view

I attempted to make an algorithm that was content agnostic and extendable. This means it would not (contrary to the implicit hierarchies of human perception) have a bias toward a certain kind of content seen within data, treating it natively in its own way.

### Synthetic Perception: Extraction Network App



I settled upon a recomposing on a grid to fracture the dataset by removing any spatial context from the elements that the algorithm picked. Essentially, the code would not *care* if it could not pick out any comprehensible details within the data that it processed.  

The video data processed have varied throughout the course of this project. I have used both self-generated and online videos chosen by web scraping and data-extracting algorithms.  

For a more comprehensive look at the research and practice which surrounds this project, feel free to read my Honours Thesis accessible [here](http://liamfpower.com/writing.html).
