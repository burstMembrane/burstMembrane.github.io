*Synthetic Perception* is an ongoing research project into the behavioural effects of digital surveillance culture on everyday social interactions.

### Synthetic Perception: installation view
 
As a year long Honours project. I experimented with using computer vision algorithms to fragment and deidentify video data. 

That data was then recomposed and output onto a display medium. These included computer screens, televisions and smartphones.

### Synthetic Perception: installation view

I attempted to make an algorithm that was content agnostic and extendable. This means it would not (contrary to the implicit hierarchies of human perception) have a bias toward a certain kind of content seen within data, treating it natively in its own way.

### Synthetic Perception: Extraction Network App



I settled upon a recomposing on a grid, to echo both the aesthetic of a surveillance network played back on multiple screens and to fracture the image further by removing any spatial context from the elements that the algoritm picked from the data. Essentially, the algorithm would not *care* if it could not pick out any comprehensible details within the data that it processes. 


I then used these algorithms to process videos shot in the style of YouTube Content Creators as well as streamed online content chosen by web scraping and data-extracting algorithms.
