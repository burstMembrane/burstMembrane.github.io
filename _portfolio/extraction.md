*Extraction* (2019) uses grid-based mediation of video to analyse and restructure networks of data mediation inherent in digital life. The increasing fragmentation of social communication blurs the distinction between real and virtual.
<br>

    The content is subordinated by the gesture in a mediated reality.
    Pixel values represent behaviour on an eight-bit scale.

    It’s a shell, a mindless exhibition of wants
    ⁣You’re a clump of flesh exhibiting desires on a scale of one to ten
    ⁣Where ten is the most profitable
    ⁣And one is the least
    ⁣And there is nothing in between that interests you
    ⁣Life dominated by a dopamine rush
    ⁣Flooding neurons and computing networks
    ⁣Echoes resonate in your subconscious⁣
    ⁣

    ⁣#progress

    ⁣#throwbackthursday ⁣
