*Extraction* (2019) uses grid-based mediation of video to analyse and restructure networks of data mediation inherent in digital life. The increasing fragmentation of social communication blurs the distinction between real and virtual.
The content is subordinated by the gesture in a mediated reality.
Pixel values represent behaviour on an eight-bit scale.
