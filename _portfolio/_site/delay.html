<p>Start reading this out loud. Shift your focus from the words to where your voice is coming from. It resonates inside your skull, chest and the cavities of your body. This resonance is called auditory feedback, and it is one of the
most essential tools humans use in communicating language. Auditory feedback helps us to regulate tone, improvise sentence structure, and maintain rhythm in our voice. Our speech output is directly connected to our sensory input.
When we delay auditory feedback, or create a gap in time between input and output, we erode this connection. This causes fragmentation in speech and a delay in communication.</p>

<p><em>Delayed Communication</em> is a work which uses a delay between speech and hearing to fragment and break down speech patterns. A microphone and headphones were setup in the gallery with a sign prompting the patron to speak
and listen to their voice break. Click play to hear a short segment of voice under the stress caused by delay.</p>
