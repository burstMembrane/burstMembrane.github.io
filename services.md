## Primary Skill Sets

#### Location Sound Recordist:

With a  wide array of microphones and professional field recording equipment, I am able to capture and record the best possible audio needed for your project on site. 



#### Specialist Sound Recording

For my own practice and in collaboration, I have a special interest in capturing hard to record or uncommon sound sources.

### Recording body sounds

For previous clients I have recorded heart, lung and body sounds, electromagnetic resonances from computers and phones and internal sounds picked up through transduction.

### Recording melting ice

#### Interaction Design and Programming

With a particular knowledge of popular creative arts programming languages such as Max/MSP, Arduino, Processing and p5.js, I can construct a custom tailored interface for your next project.

For past clients I have built MIDI routers, interactive sound sculptures and custom hardware solutions to help them achieve their creative and practical needs.  

#### Live Sound

Coming from a background in Sound Art, my passion lies in creating a mood and atmosphere that helps foreground the source material in a physical space. This often means making decisions on site and in the planning process that will facilitate this.

![Mixing](images/reel/mixing.jpg)

I have mixed live gigs, experimental art performances and theatre productions.


#### Mixing and Sound Design

As well as capturing sound on site, I can provide mixing facilities and post-video sync work for small scale projects or individual clients.
