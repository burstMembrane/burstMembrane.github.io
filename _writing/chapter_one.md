# CHAPTER ONE
## RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

With the increasing mediation of our everyday lives by computing technologies come questions about their impact on human behaviour and their use as surveillance terminals for tech corporations. My research project Synthetic Perception investigates these impacts and their context in contemporary art. Through a series of works that utilize the tools of data-extraction and manipulation common in the digital era, I aim to expose and critique the structures which modify the behaviour of the individual. Furthermore, my research looks critically at the current era of big data filtered through a revised application of Guy Debord’s ‘Society of the Spectacle’. I will approach the processes of data extraction and manipulation via Debord’s notion that the Spectacle mediates social relations and human behaviour into a form of representation; and that this spectacular image then becomes the central point of social communication in the modern world (Debord 1967, p.13). This idea will be addressed in practice and research, updating it to account for our present era of computer run, data-driven commodity capitalism. 

Taking the guise of a digital content creator, I will use the forms native to digital culture: networked video, YouTube reviews, vlog and online video to create a detournement of the updated Spectacle. The use of these formats of cultural production and consumption reflect the changes evident in the digital era. (Clemens Nash 2006, p.8) Translated to a display interface and synchronized over a network, the “raw” data becomes meaningful only in it’s ready compartmentalization by human perception. This occurs in an age where authenticity is in doubt and the real/virtual divide is fragmenting and collapsing.
