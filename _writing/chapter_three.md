# CHAPTER THREE
## The détournement of networked data: Restructuring surveillance and the Spectacle

Guy Debord’s seminal text “The Society of the Spectacle” was created in an atmosphere of social unrest and agitation associated with the Situationist Movement in late 1960s France. The movement was born as a reaction to the rapid industrialisation and modernisation in post-war Europe (Briziarelli & Armano 2017, p. 18). Crafted in this context, it is now widely regarded as an impassioned critique of the invasion of late-stage capitalism into the life, mind, and desires of the modern individual. It is also a historical text associated with the rise of modern consumer culture in Western countries at the time. While the Spectacle is redefined multiple times in Debord’s text, it can be understood as a way of viewing a process of alienation and mediation into an individual’s life perpetrated by dominant power structures in commodity capitalism (Debord 1967).  In Debord’s view, the machinations of moden capitalism represented by the Spectacle had at the time of writing reached unprecedented levels. It had become connected with and partially appropriated everyday life through the mass media and consumer culture.  

The Spectacle mediates the social, economic, and political relationships of the individual with the world around them, but also with the construction of their own self-image (Debord,1967). Further, the Spectacle alienates the individual from their supposed real or authentic desires, morphing social life from being, to having, and then appearing (1967, p.16). It is important to note that while the Spectacle was disseminated through mass media it was intended by Debord to be understood as a more general process of mediation into the life of the individual (Briziarelli & Armano, 2017), in which media and Spectacular events were just parts of a greater whole. This critique was influential and, arguably, effective as an indictment of the more simplistic forms of financial capitalism rampant at the time of its writing because, in that period, there was a much more top-down hierarchical relationship between the media, advertising and consumers. This hierarchy mainly existed through technologies like television, radio, and newspapers. 
With the advent and wide adoption of the internet and computing technologies since the late 1990s, a phenomenon that has made the individual’s relationship to media more insidious and symbiotic, it is now imperative that Debord’s Spectacle is updated to bring it in line with the processes that drive digital consumer culture. One approach to this is presented by contemporary scholars who see Debord’s Spectacle as the complex unifying force which “colonises most spheres of social life by the processes of commodification, exploitation and reification” (Briziarelli & Armano 2017, p.17). These processes are the methods by which the modern individual is alienated from their unmediated or authentic desires.  Barile argues that the Spectacle manifests itself in the contemporary era via the “cognitive exploitation” of the consumer (Barile 2017, p. 152).

The Spectacle, in this way, encourages users to upload their own content, but also to tag and create networks between their content and others (Barile 2017, p.154). By the self-creation of networked or aggregated content, demographic data can be extracted and exploited for advertising. In effect, the user is conducting their own market research by signifying their values and constructing a personal brand. This data can then be analysed to “extract the main qualitative information about his/her preferences, tastes, feelings etc.” (Barile 2017, p. 154). The conclusion of this form of Spectacle is the creation of a consumer that, through self-branding and uploading of content, actively participates in their own exploitation. Their everyday life, uploaded as data and self-organised through tags and links, becomes a cognitive commodity that can be exploited. Furthermore, as these data-analysis algorithms are only ever revealed to the user through an interface that hides their true machinations, there is a real problem with the lack of transparency associated with these algorithms. This feature makes exploitation of consumer data possible. 

One of the central tenets of a Situationists’ agenda was the critique of everyday life (Briziarelli and Armano, p.18). For them, daily subjectivities of the individual had to be defined, analysed and critiqued in order to extract their links to the machinations of late-capitalism. Further, this process of critique of everyday life could eventually lead to a higher point of self-awareness, where the individual is able to identify the processes that shape their subjectivities. The individual would then, hopefully, be empowered to choose at which level they will engage with these constructs. In my research I have worked to expose the processes that drive Surveillance Capitalism and Spectacular Culture through the appropriation and exposition of the algorithms and interfaces that form the primary drivers of the Information Economy. One method I use is the creation of a détournement. A détournement attempts to create a counter-Spectacle activity by utilising the techniques of mass-media dissemination in the creation of new, revolutionary artworks. The aim of these techniques is to expose those processes that make the Spectacle possible, but also to better ground the individual to their place in history (Briziarelli & Armano 2017, p.20).

In 1973, Guy Debord directed a film version of The Society of the Spectacle. This film accompanies a reading of the text with images gleaned from pop culture. The Vietnam War, fashion models, political ### Figures, and movie scenes feature as symbols of the Spectacle in mass media. It presents these clips seemingly disconnected from the text: sometimes the content on screen is synchronised with the narration, other times it is not. This rather heavy-handed filmic construction appears somewhat dated to 2019 eyes as it utilises some of the more superficial manifestations of the Spectacle in an effort to create an access point for an audience specific to the time. The main ideological thrust of this combination of images and text is to suggest a correlation between these images and reflections of the Spectacle in everyday life, taking the theory and discourse of the Situationists and connecting it to visions of the world. 

In the context of digital culture, many of these spectacular processes have shifted online through the behavioural patterns encouraged by social media and sharing platforms. In light of this, an effective détournement in the contemporary era that didn’t include networked video, or incorporate some of the processes used to share data on digital platforms, would be critically flawed. Hito Steyerl’s (2013) updating of detournement, which she terms Circulationism, involves refocusing from the creation of a unique, singular image as artwork. In its place she envisages an artistic practice that manipulates and restructures found images (and data) in order to expose the “public relations of images across social networks” (Steyerl 2013, p.7). Tapping into detournement’s theoretical ancestry as a Situationist concept, for Steyerl, Circulationism is the rearrangement of images to show how they are presented and shared, rather than just as content-carriers in and of themselves. An example of Circulationism as practised in Steyerl’s own work is Factory of the Sun (2015). There Steyerl uses post-production techniques associated with video games, YouTube videos and other aspects of digital culture to construct a narrative which presents workers forced to create artificial sunlight through dance routines.  Ideas and approaches like this have informed my thinking and work in the development of the algorithms that underpin my practice-led approach. I created videos using both live-feeds and ripped YouTube videos which are run through thresholding and sorting algorithms. This encourages questions on how images are constructed, communicated and produced.
