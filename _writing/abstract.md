# ABSTRACT:

As computing technologies are weft into the fabric of everyday life, their use by tech corporations as sources of data for advertising becomes a major concern. Their attempt to mediate, categorize and quantify human behaviour on a large scale should be exposed and critiqued by any means possible. The opacity of the data-manipulation algorithms used means that the everyday user is becoming increasingly distanced from what their data is being used for and by whom. This project aims to reinterpret and critique the algorithmic processing of users through code-based video and sonic outcomes. It questions the techniques used to interact with technological surveillance, whose primary aim is to automate human behaviour for profit.
