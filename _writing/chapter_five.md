# CHAPTER FIVE
## Self-Driving Cars on the Information Superhighway: Community of Practice

My practice sits within a global network of media artists that explore technology, data and surveillance and their impacts on society. In 2019, Trevor Paglen and Kate Crawford released ImageNet Roulette, which allows users to upload an image that is then classified using the “Person” subset of the ImageNet database. ImageNet is one of the largest object classification algorithms publicly available, one that is being used to train facial recognition and classification systems worldwide.

### Fig 21: Paglen and Crawford: ImageNet Roulette (2019)
When I uploaded a self-portrait to the site, I received the classification of “Melancholic, melancholiac”; a clear value judgement based upon the expression and framing of the image. This application was intended by Paglen and Crawford to highlight the inherent hierarchies and sociopolitical judgements in Artificial Intelligence systems (2019, p.1). The fourteen million images on which the ImageNet database is trained are scraped from online sources and classified by side-hustle workers on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform (Paglen and Crawford 2019, p.12). The process of sorting people into categories is thus based upon the social and political bias of the anonymous online workers who label the images. This quickly becomes apparent by the way the categorisations are sorted. For example, according to the database there are only two categories for a person, “Male” and “Female”. This shows a serious bias, forgetting the identification of any person whose identity does not fall within these predefined categories (2019, p.15). The assumption of these datasets is that images of the world can be ordered and categorised into repeatable classifications. This is a profoundly deterministic viewpoint which implies that through images we are able to understand and sort the chaos of existence into neatly predefined categories. Categorization is thus always a social and political activity — the technical systems that underlie Artificial Intelligence are inescapably intertwined with the social and political values of the era in which they were constructed. Just as Paglen and Crawford’s work highlights these flaws, I am also consciously addressing the inherent bias of these networks in my work with thresholding and restructuring algorithms. 
One way my project addresses these concerns is by cropping images based upon brightness. As a functional surveillance algorithm my experiments are useless. They have the opposite effect to classification algorithms: de-identifying any human subjects within the frame to a bundle of shifting luminance values and abstracting the frame beyond human readability. David Rokeby’s Sorting Daemon (2003) sorts a live camera feed by hue using a colour algorithm. In this work people are cropped and sorted according to arbitrary parameters set by the artist. This work was made in reaction to the spike in automated profiling of individuals during the Global War on Terror. It questions automated mechanisms for sorting surveillance footage by the use of a real time, interactive application.

Kyle McDonald works directly with code to create applications and installations that utilize data available on the internet. In his work Exhausting a Crowd (2015), surveillance cameras setup in Gwangju, London, Birmingham, and the Netherlands film public spaces. Users on the site are then invited to tag and track people within the frame, leading to a crowdsourced and often manic overload of speculative commentary.

Open-sourced and uploaded to GitHub, this work shows the use of algorithmic mediation in a video feed in order to empower the user to make decisions about what is of interest in the frame 
McDonald, in turn, was himself influenced by The Girl Chewing Gum (1976) (Exhausting a Crowd Github, 2013), a video work made by John Smith, where a narrator absurdly directs action on a busy London Street.

As the video progresses it is revealed that the narration is not recorded in sync with the pictures seen on screen and becomes increasingly abstract and subjective in its description of events being recorded. This tactic of tagging and deconstructing a video from a remote location has had a notable effect on my work, although, I have chosen to allow the computing system to decide what is important rather than narrating the scene subjectively as in these works. In this way, my algorithmic process shares a thematic link to the chaotic labelling of Lozano Hemmer’s Subtitled Public (2013). In Hemmer’s work spectators are detected by cameras, then tracked and labeled with a randomly generated conjugated verb e.g. taste, inconvenience, within the gallery space. In Hemmer’s words, the work is intended to “highlight the arbitrariness of computerised surveillance systems” (Hemmer, para 2) in tagging and labelling human behaviour.

Lauren McCarthy creates applications and software art which is inspired by the digital world: in particular, its effect on social behavior and privacy. In her work Lauren (2019), she takes on the role of a smart home assistant like that of Amazon’s Alexa. Users sign up on a website to get a kit of surveillance equipment delivered to their homes, after which McCarthy monitors their requests, answers questions, and retrieves information. This work looks at the ‘smart’ home concept in a new, critical light: Would we be comfortable if there was a real human listening in and watching our everyday activities rather than an easily dehumanized algorithm? While some works exist in a traditional institutional framework, others exist in software, some are web-based, and many combine methods of gallery and web/software presentation and performance. These artists all work with a common technological interface as the primary medium through which their art is enacted.

### Fig 26: Hito Steyerl - How Not To Be Seen: A Fucking Didactic Educational .MOV File (2013)
As mentioned in chapter three, Hito Steyerl’s work has provided an important contextual marker in the way images are composed and distributed in the digital era. Her use of green screen, manipulated digital video, text to speech and found footage in How Not To Be Seen: A Fucking Didactic Educational .MOV File (2013) invites a critical awareness of how content and images are produced and distributed. Often ironic or tongue in cheek, this work has been particularly influential in the creation of content for my own project. In a 2013 interview regarding the project, Steyerl proposes that in the contemporary era the meaning of images has been unshackled from their singular content, instead gaining meaning cumulatively from its quantity and method of distribution (Kunak 2013, para 2). This sharpened my thinking regarding the breakdown and restructuring of images in my trial presentations, as well as my use of the aesthetics and formal tropes of digital culture to frame my video works e.g. the YouTube interface. Steyerl also mentions that surveillance capitalism has led to a state of “over-visibility” (2013, para 2), where people are scanned and interpreted as digital images. This state of increased visibility makes it harder for people to opt-out or disappear and, taking it further, Steyerl raises the question if people have now in fact “become images” (Kunak 2013 para 2). 
 
Considerations regarding the display medium were inspired by the, now considerable, history of artists working with video and screens within the gallery space. Harun Farocki’s work Workers Leaving the Factory in Eleven Decades (2006) shows twelve screens, playing video loops of found footage.

While our content may differ, Farocki’s use of multiple screens networked together by an associated image palette has both intrigued me and guided my research with regards to the place, use and status of the interface. Seen together, his video array in Workers Leaving the Factory in Eleven Decades (2006) suggest a system at play; there is a connective element in his use of space and content which makes the work greater than the sum of its individual parts. In Deep Play (2007), the 2006 World Cup is shown from twelve different angles. Computer generated imagery melds with broadcast footage, providing a forensic deconstruction of the event from different angles. The “clean feed” (Diederichsen 2007) is abstracted with visualisations of the flow of play generated algorithmically. Farocki also suggests digital culture by explaining that the feed is “classified, assessed and transferred to other systems” (Diederichsen 2007) in the eleven nodes accompanying the clean signal.

In conclusion, I have shown a variety of artists who ask similar questions to myself in the progression of this research project. These artists form a representative sample defining the scope of my inquiry, though there are many significant works which are not mentioned. A defining factor in their work is a questioning of how data, performed through media, functions within society and by whom it is being manipulated.  How that function is updated with the advent of new technologies remains unclear, but it is a question which will undoubtedly be of interest to artists such as myself as the Information Age progresses. I will continue to ask these questions: retrieving the human-readable fragments in an ever-expanding sea of data and scrutinizing the collapsing divide between the online and offline worlds. As humanity’s perception of itself becomes increasingly augmented by computing technologies, the artists’ role may become less to question how data functions in a human world, but how humans can reconcile their new dual identity as dataset and organism.
