<p><em>Synthetic Perception</em> is an ongoing research project into the behavioural effects of digital surveillance culture on everyday social interactions.</p>

<p>As a year long Honours project. I experimented with using computer vision algorithms to fragment and deidentify video data.</p>

<p>That data was then recomposed and output onto a display medium. These included computer screens, televisions and smartphones.</p>

<p>I attempted to make an algorithm that was content agnostic and extendable. This means it would not (contrary to the implicit hierarchies of human perception) have a bias toward a certain kind of content seen within data, treating it natively in its own way.</p>

<p>I settled upon a recomposing on a gri to fracture the dataset by removing any spatial context from the elements that the algorithm picked. Essentially, the code would not <em>care</em> if it could not pick out any comprehensible details within the data that it processed.</p>

<p>The video data processed have varied throughout the course of this project. I have used both self-generated and online videos chosen by web scraping and data-extracting algorithms.</p>
