<p><a href="https://www.thismaskdoesnotexist.herokuapp.com"><em>This mask does not exist</em></a>
is an online work which displays images generated by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network">Generative Adversarial Network</a>.</p>

<p>This network is trained to create images of people wearing face masks, after mask wearing was made mandatory in Melbourne following huge spikes in COVID-19 transmission.</p>

<p>In this work I trained an algorithm with a large dataset of mask images. After training the GAN can then begin to make inferences about their style and features. Holding the sum of these images in itâ€™s memory, the network can map these features to synthesize new content.</p>

<p>AI and machine learning are today mainly used in corporate and government applications. Advertisers use AI to figure out what you might buy next. Facebook and Google use AI to try and pre-empt and automate human behaviour towards the goals of their platforms. My use of these algorithms attempts to demystify and uncover the flaws in these approaches. In this work I use these systems in a scientifically unsound way, seeing what will happen when the algorithm is fed with dirty data, or undertrained.</p>
