<p>With a  wide array of microphones and professional field recording equipment, I am able to capture and record the best possible audio needed for your project on site.</p>

<h4 id="specialist-sound-recording">Specialist Sound Recording</h4>

<p>For my own practice and in collaboration, I have a special interest in capturing hard to record or uncommon sound sources.</p>

<p>With a particular knowledge of popular creative arts programming languages such as Max/MSP, Arduino, Processing and p5.js, I can construct a custom tailored interface for your next project.</p>

<p><img src="images/reel/max.png" alt="Max/MSP" /></p>

<p>For past clients I have built MIDI routers, interactive sound sculptures and custom hardware solutions to help them achieve their creative and practical needs.</p>

<h4 id="live-sound">Live Sound</h4>

<p>Coming from a background in Sound Art, my passion lies in creating a mood and atmosphere that helps foreground the source material in a physical space. This often means making decisions on site and in the planning process that will facilitate this.</p>

<p><img src="images/reel/mixing.jpg" alt="Mixing" /></p>

<p>I have mixed live gigs, experimental art performances and theatre productions.</p>

<h4 id="mixing-and-sound-design">Mixing and Sound Design</h4>

<p>As well as capturing sound on site, I can provide mixing facilities and post-video sync work for small scale projects or individual clients.</p>
