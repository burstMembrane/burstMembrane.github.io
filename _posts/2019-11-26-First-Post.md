Hi, this is my first blog post on this site. I'm going to try and keep it updated with fun art/code related activities in the future. Keep an eye on this space for tutorials and updates.

I've been wanting to write a blog for some time, but have been tossing up which content I could include and the workflow for adding posts.

Perhaps my first post could provide a little breakdown of how this blog was concieved and what I'll be using it for.

Using ![Prose](prose.io) on my phone, I can update and write blog posts on the go. 

I'll be posting some tutorials, videos, art and thoughts periodically.
